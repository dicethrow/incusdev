# LXDEV: Remote dev tools with LXD

This is a python library for interacting with LXD containers in order to do containerised development.

This repo is to reduce code duplication because it is so useful to me.

This could be modified to work with any container system (or remote server)  that can use SSH, SCP and/or file sharing.

## Installation and use

- Install this library with

```bash
host $ venv activate <your-python-env>
host $ pip3 install --editable <this-directory> #  so source code changes will be used
```
